Exercise 17: Centralizing Data Fetching with Custom Hooks


Description: 

Explain the benefits of using custom hooks like useFetch for data fetching.

Answer:

1. Code Reusability
Instead of duplicating fetch logic in every component, you define it once in useFetch and reuse it wherever needed.
2. Cleaner Component Code
It separates concerns — the component focuses on rendering, and the hook handles data fetching. This makes components shorter, more readable, and easier to maintain.
3. Encapsulation of Side Effects
All side-effect logic (like fetch, aborting on unmount, etc.) lives inside the hook, which keeps your components stateless and predictable.
4. Testability
Custom hooks can be tested independently from UI components, making unit testing easier and more modular.
5. Consistency
Every component using useFetch handles loading, errors, and data the same way — no logic drift or inconsistent state
6. Scalability
When your app grows, you can extend the hook (e.g., add caching, retries, pagination) without refactoring every place that fetches data.
